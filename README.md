# How to use
In the `spotify-autofollow.py` script, replace `<API_TOKEN>` with a token generated by Spotify that has the following permissions:
* user-library-read
* user-follow-modify
See the following to play with the spotify web console where you can also generate an API token with the above permissions: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks/
Just click "Get Token" and select the permissions you want to give the token.

Then, just run the following to follow all artists that are saved to your library:
`$ py spotify-autofollow.py`

It will then print out each unique artist ID that was returned and will auto-follow every artist that is in this unique id list.
